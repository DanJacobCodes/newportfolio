          <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
          <span>
            <p>My name is Dan Jacob as you can tell by the giant header. I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I studied Business Administration while in college. I've recently interned as an editorial writer before relocating to Seattle to attend Epicodus! In my downtime, I enjoy listening to music (hip-hop), reading, writing, learning about design, tech, and business. I'm a huge sports fan, my favorite teams being the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Los Angeles Lakers! </p>
